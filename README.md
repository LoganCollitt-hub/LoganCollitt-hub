# 👋 Hi, I'm Logan

I'm a second-year MSc Bioinformatics student at Teesside University with a strong foundation in Animal Science and Welfare (BSc). My work bridges **computational biology and animal health**, with a particular interest in microbiomes, genomics, and data‑driven approaches to understanding wildlife, captive and domestic species.

My undergraduate dissertation focused on **investigating the gut microbiome of the red panda**, which strengthened my passion for applying bioinformatics to animal welfare, conservation, and comparative genomics.
