# 👋 Hi, I'm Logan

I'm a second-year MSc Bioinformatics student at Teesside University with a strong foundation in Animal Science and Welfare (BSc). My work bridges **computational biology and animal health**, with a particular interest in microbiomes, genomics, and data‑driven approaches to understanding wildlife, captive and domestic species.

During my BSc, I carried out a dissertation investigating the **gut microbiome of the red panda (Ailurus fulgens)**, exploring how microbial communities relate to digestive ecology and captive welfare.
I am now expanding my research interests to **royal pythons (Python regius)**, studying their biology and exploring how computational methods can support reptile health, welfare, and conservation.


## Featured & Upcoming Projects
- 🐾 **Red Panda Gut Microbiome Analysis**  
A comprehensive study of the red panda gut microbiome using diversity metrics, taxonomic profiling, and ecological interpretation to explore potential links between microbial composition, diet, and welfare in captivity.
- 🐍 **Royal Python Biology & Health Analytics**
A project investigating key biological and health parameters in royal pythons, including microbiome ecology, metabolic traits, stress indicators, and comparative genomic patterns relevant to captive welfare and conservation.
